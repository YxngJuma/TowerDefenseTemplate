# TowerDefenseTemplate
 I built the tower map
 struggled with fixing the monster shooting at the bear
 on the first video I just focused on building a tilemap
 fixed where i can place tilemap on my tower map
 2nd is where i focused on adding codes and making sure everything is smooth
 I add a camera where 
 I made it where the monnster can shoot
 I made built the map
 I made it where the monsters can 
made the tile where the bears can follow the path
struggled with making the health damage
added the monster on top right where i can place they wherever i want
made bullets
i can place as many monsters as i can on the map
all the monsters can shoot
